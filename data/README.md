Data used in the project:

- *from_chris.txt* is the list of emails from Chris
- *from_sara.txt* is the list of emails from Sara
- *maildir* is the directory containing the mails from the Eron Corpus dataset. This directory gets generated when running the `startup.py` setup script. 
- *test_email* is a test email to test some of the pre-precosess code
- *word_data.pkl* is the list of email content sent by either Sara or Chris. This is generated by running `create_pickle_files.py` and using the 'from_*.txt' files.
- *email_author.pkl* is the list of authors for the email content in word_data.pkl: 0 for Sara and 1 for Chris. This is generated by running `create_pickle_files.py` and using the 'from_*.txt' files.
- *emails_finances.pkl* is a pickled dictionary of dictionaries created by Udacity (see [here](https://github.com/udacity/ud120-projects/blob/master/final_project/final_project_dataset.pkl)) and it contains several _finances_ info for the people in the Enron dataset. 
The dataset has the form:
 
    `enron_data["LASTNAME FIRSTNAME MIDDLEINITIAL"] = { features_dict }`
  
  where `{features_dict}` is a dictionary of features associated with that person.
